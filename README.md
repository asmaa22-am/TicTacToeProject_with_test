### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd tictactoe-game
   ```

2. **Build with CMake**
   ```bash
   mkdir build
   cd build

   ```

## üéØ How to Use

### Getting Started
1. **Launch the application**
2. **Create an account** or **sign in** with existing credentials
3. **Choose your game mode** from the main menu

### Game Modes

#### Player vs Player (PvP)
- Enter names for both players
- Take turns clicking on the board
- First player uses 'X', second player uses 'O'

#### Player vs AI (PvAI)
- Enter your player name
- You play as 'X', AI plays as 'O'
- AI uses advanced Minimax algorithm for optimal moves

### Additional Features

#### View Game History
- Access complete history of all played games
- See game modes, winners, and timestamps
- Navigate through chronological game records

#### Replay Games
- Select any previous game from the dropdown
- Watch animated replay of moves
- Review game strategies and decision points

## üß† AI Algorithm

The AI opponent uses the **Minimax algorithm** with the following characteristics:

- **Perfect Play**: AI makes optimal moves assuming perfect opponent play
- **Evaluation Function**: 
  - +10 for AI win
  - -10 for player win  
  - 0 for draw
- **Game Tree Search**: Explores all possible game states
- **Performance Optimized**: Efficient pruning and move evaluation

## üìä Performance Monitoring

The application includes comprehensive performance tracking:

### Metrics Tracked
- **Database Operations**: Query execution times
- **AI Decision Making**: Minimax algorithm performance
- **Login Operations**: Authentication timing
- **Game Duration**: Complete game timing
- **System Resources**: Memory and CPU usage (Windows)

### Performance Display
- Real-time metrics shown after each game
- Average, minimum, and maximum timing data
- Resource usage monitoring
- Performance data export capabilities

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema

### Users Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    username TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password_hash TEXT NOT NULL,
    salt TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Game History Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE game_history (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    username TEXT NOT NULL,
    game_mode TEXT NOT NULL,
    winner TEXT NOT NULL,
    moves TEXT NOT NULL,
    timestamp DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY(username) REFERENCES users(username)
);
```
